oco2_modis_vistool.py

The purpose of this script is to pull Aqua-MODIS RGB images from Worldview
using the NASA GIBS API and overlay various OCO-2 data fields for case study 
analysis in support of OCO-2 cloud and aerosol screening validation.

GIBS developer documentation:https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/GIBS/GIBS+API+for+Developers

Minimum command line call:
python oco2_modis_vistool.py

Output:
Image (.png) named variable_region_date_quality_warn.png by default in specified output directory (default: code directory)

Runtime Requirements:

1) json configuration file (default: oco2_modis_vistool_config.json in code directory)
2) This script is meant to run on ocomaster at Colorado State University. 
   To run it elsewhere, the data locations will need to be updated 
   and modules will need to be verified.
   
Other Requirements:
GDAL 1.7.3, released 2010/11/10

Configurable Parameters:
Required:
    date (string, "YYYY-MM_DD"): The date of your case study. This is used to get the correct RGB.
    geo_upper_left (list,[lat, lon]): The latitude and longitude coordinates of the upper left hand corner of your area of interest.
    geo_lower_right (list, [lat, lon]): The latitude and longitude coordinates of the lower right hand corner of your area of interest.
    
Optional:
    region (string, default: none): The region of your case study. This is used to build the default output filename.
    cmap (string, default: "jet"): The desired colormap. Options can be found here: http://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps_reference.html
    oco2_overlay_info (dict, default: none): The information for the OCO-2 variable to overlay on the MODIS RGB
        file (string): This is required for a variable overlay. The full path to the file that contains the variable to overlay.
	variable (string, "Preprocessors/dp_adp"): This is required for a variable overlay. The full path to the variable within the file specified. 
	variable_plot_lims (list, [min, max], default: [integer floor of variable's minimum value, integer ceiling of variable's maximum value]):
	                    The maximum and minimum values used for plotting and color assignment. Any data values beyond the min and max will show up on the plot as the
			    minimum or maximum color, respectively.
        lat_name (string, "latitude"): This is required for a variable overlay. The name of the latitude array associated with the variable. Used for subsetting and plotting.
	lon_name (string, "longitude"): This is required for a variable overlay. The name of the longitude array associated with the variable. Used for subsetting and plotting.
	orbit (integer, 11016): This is required for a variable overlay if the variable is contained in a lite file. Used for subsetting.
	lite_QF (string, "good", default: "all"): The quality flag applied to your variable. Used for filtering. Options: "good", "bad", "all"
	lite_warn_lims (list, [0,15], default: [0,20]): The range of acceptable warn levels applied to your variable. Used for filtering. Options: integers from 0 to 20
    ground_site (list, [lat lon], default: none): The latitude and longitude coordinates of a ground site of interest. It will show up as a white star on the output plot.
    output_dir (string, default: the directory that you are running the code in): The full output directory path where you would like the output plot to be generated
    outfile (string, default: variable_region_date_quality_warn.png, default example: xco2_Amazon_20150701_all_quality_WL_0to20.png): The name of the output plot
